# Kitsuned
A Balatro mod that adds some new things.

## Current Additions
### PokerHands
**Cat/Dog:** New [poker hand ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_poker_hand#Cats_and_dogs "poker hand ")with associated Joker cards.
> **NOTE:** *Straights* will have priority over *Cat/Dog* in case of conflict.

### Jokers
**Fox:** Expands valid Cat/Dog hands by allowing all High Low combinations (Ace is always high)

**Pet Bowl:** Save surplus chips for when you are a little short

## Todo
* More jokers, enchaments, stickers, and much more
* Low Ace Fox (Cat/Dog)
* Better Art
* Possibly a boss blind

## Issues
* Cat/Dog hands likley will break if playing more than 5 cards.
* Typos, always typos
