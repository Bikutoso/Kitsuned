# Kitsuned
A Balatro mod mainly for me to experiment and learn from. Some ideas might be pulled into and expanded opun as standalone mods in the future.

I will try and balance my mod to be somewhat vanilla-ish, but it might have some more unbalanced and stronger elements.


Any help is appricated and will help me greatly in better support a gmore ame i love and stronger elements.

Optional support for [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman), but will work without it.

## Current Additions
### Poker Hands
**Cat/Dog:** New [poker hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_poker_hand#Cats_and_dogs) with associated Joker cards.
> **NOTE:** *Straights* will have priority over *Cat/Dog* in case of conflict.

### Jokers
**Fox:** Expands valid Cat/Dog hands by allowing all High Low combinations (Ace is always high)

**Pet Bowl:** Save surplus chips for when you are a little short

**Rain:** Incrased chips each played hand, but not playing enough and it will start to dry.

### Challanges
**Self Made:** Start with a minimal deck and slowly build up

## Todo
* More jokers, enchaments, stickers, and much more
* Possibly a Low Ace Fox (Cat/Dog)
* Better Art
* Possibly a boss blind

## Issues
* Typos, always typos
* Cat/Dog can never play more than 5 cards
