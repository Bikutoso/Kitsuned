# Kitsuned
An animal/pet themed mod that intorduced the Cat/Dog hand and other fun edditons.

Somewhat vanilla-ish, but it might have some more unbalanced and stronger elements.


Any help is appricated and will help me greatly in better support a gmore ame i love and stronger elements.

Optional support for [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman), but will work without it.

## Current Additions
### Poker Hands
**Cat/Dog:** New [poker hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_poker_hand#Cats_and_dogs) with associated Joker cards.
> **NOTE:** *Straights* will have priority over *Cat/Dog* in case of conflict.

### Jokers
**Fox:** Expands valid Cat/Dog hands by allowing all High Low combinations (Ace is always high)

**Pet Bowl:** Save surplus chips for when you are a little short

**Rain:** Incrased chips each played hand, but not playing enough and it will start to dry.

**Ribbon:** Exponent Mult Legendary that scales with how many challanges are complete.
> **NOTE:** Unlock condition is actually "Complete a Challenge"

## Todo
* More jokers, enchaments, stickers, and much more
* Possibly a Low Ace Fox (Cat/Dog)
* Better Art
